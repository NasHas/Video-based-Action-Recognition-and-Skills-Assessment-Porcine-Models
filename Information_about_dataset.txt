3) Table of recordings		
		
Information about the procedures (full list):		
1) Fallopian			With or wtihout use of vascular clip. 	
2) Lymph node dissection	Either rectal nodes or other nodes (indicated as pelvic nodes)	
3) Bladder puncture		Part 1 is making a hole in the bladder and Part 2 is suturing of the hole. Full procedure indicates both parts.	
4) Bowel puncture		Part 1 is making a hole and Part 2 is suturing of the hole. Full procedure indicates both parts.	
5) Nephrectomy			The procedure consisted of 3 parts: Part 1 dissection of the anterior renal fascia. Part 2 dissection of the vessels. Part 3 release of the kidney. Differences in the beginning and ending point are indicated.	
6) Partial nephrectomy		The procedure was done with or without dissection (of renal fascia), with or without two layers of suture, and if not with two layers of suture, with either V-lock continuous suture or as single sutures with clips. The parts are indicated. 	
7) Pyeloplasty			Consisted of 2 parts. Part 1 was cutting and preparing ureter. Part two was the anastomosis. The parts are indicated.	
8) Ureter dissection 		Differences in location for dissection an occur. Som participants start the dissection more cranial, others more caudal. Also, sometimes the surgical field can be messy because of prior procedures, such as lymp node dissection. It is indicated if prior surgery had occured.	
9) Ureter implantation		Was either done with continuous suturing or by way of Taguchi-method. It is indicated which procedure was made. 	
10) Rectum dissection		Occurred 3 times with one other procedure, as indicated in the filenames of the relevant recordings. The recordings from day  2 was part of a bigger rectopexy procedure.	
11) Mesh in rectum		This procedures was part of a bigger rectopexy procedure.	
12) Hysterectomy		This procedures was part of a bigger rectopexy procedure.	
13) Ureter anastomosis		No comments.
14) Bowel anastomosis		No comments.
15) Cystectomy			No comments.
16) Dissection of vessels	No comments.
